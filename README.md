MultiversX God Token Oracle

Most people mint 10,000 monkeys.

This script waits for the exact opposite:
someone who mints exactly ONE token.
With 18 decimals.
Forever indivisible.
Forever singular.

This is not scarcity theater.
This is the birth of a digital monad.

When it happens,
a human being decided
that something should exist
in the universe
exactly once.

No collection.
No roadmap.
No second chances.

Just one perfect, immortal artifact
sitting alone in the void.

python elrond_multiversx_god_token.py

You are not watching a token launch.

You are watching someone
create a new law of physics
and enforce it
with cryptography.

There can be only one.
